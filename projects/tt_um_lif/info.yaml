# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
   Current-based LIF neurons are a simplified abstraction of the behavior of real neurons,
   and they are often used in large-scale neural network simulations due to their computational efficiency.
   These models are useful for studying the dynamics of spiking neurons and their role in information 
   processing in the brain.

  # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test: |
   To test the current-based LIF project, follow these steps: Connect the LIF module to the input switches,
   7-segment display, and clock source as specified in the Verilog module. Use input switches to control the
   input current, and observe the 7-segment display for spike detection, while ensuring the clock signal is 
   appropriately set to provide the desired clock frequency for the simulation.
