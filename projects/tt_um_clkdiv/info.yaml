  top_module:  "tt_um_clkdiv"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Divider up it 16bit input and a simple random number"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a set of registers to divide the clock.
    
      Both 8 bit input are used for the divider
    
      Can divide up to 65565, target uses 20 Mhz as example.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the clock should be divided by the input a 20MHz input clock.
      Experiment by changing the inputs

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
    - division input bit 0
    - division input bit 1
    - division input bit 2
    - division input bit 3
    - division input bit 4
    - division input bit 5
    - division input bit 6
    - division input bit 7
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - uo_out[0] clock output
    - Random Number Output
    - Random Number Output
    - Random Number Output
    - Random Number Output
    - Random Number Output
    - Random Number Output
    - Random Number Output
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - division input bit 8
    - division input bit 9
    - division input bit 10
    - division input bit 11
    - division input bit 12
    - division input bit 13
    - division input bit 14
    - division input bit 15
