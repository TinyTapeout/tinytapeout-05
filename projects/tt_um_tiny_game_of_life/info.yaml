  how_it_works: |

      The design uses to shift registers to play the game: a load register and an update register. 
      After the entire grid is sequentially loaded in, the circuit plays the game indefinitely, outputting the state of each cell sequentially in the process. 
      
      Simulation operates on 3 distinct states: INPUT, UPDATE, and OUTPUT. 
      INPUT: The values of the grid are loaded into the circuit, 1 cell at a time. Cells are organized in row-major order. The user must indicate a transition from INPUT to UPDATE through a special input combination. The circuit can hold a total of 64 values at a time; after that, the oldest values are pushed out of the grid
      UPDATE: The user may transition from INPUT to UPDATE by asserting ui_in[1]. UPDATE takes a single clock cycle, since all cells in the grid are updated in parallel. After UPDATE, the FSM automatically transitions to OUTPUT
      OUTPUT: The updated cells are outputted sequentially. uo_out[0] holds the bit being outputted, while uo_out[2:1] holds the current state of the FSM. After all cells have been outputted, the FSM switches back to UPDATE.

      Unless reset, the FSM alternates between UPDATE and OUTPUT states without any further input from the user.

      State Assignments:  00 --> INPUT
                          01 --> UPDATE
                          10 --> OUTPUT
      
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Load values through ui_i[0] and start the game through ui_i[1]. Pray it works.
