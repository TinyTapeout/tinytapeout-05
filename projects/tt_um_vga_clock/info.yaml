# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Shows the time on a VGA screen"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Races the beam! Font is pre generated and loaded into registers. 6 bit colour keeps register count low.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Hook up a VGA monitor to the outputs and provide a clock at 31.5 MHz. Connect the 6 bit colour output up with resistors to make
      a R2R DAC. See the circuit here: https://github.com/mattvenn/6bit-pmod-vga
