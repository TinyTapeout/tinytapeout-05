# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      A ring oscillator with a 64-bit counter that counts the number of oscillations. The counter is connected to pins ou_out,
      and is shifted by the cnt_shift input. The counter is reset when cnt_reset is high, and stops when cnt_stop is high.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set inputs 0 to 5 to the desired counter shift value, and observe the counter on outputs 0 to 7.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
    - cnt_shift[0]
    - cnt_shift[1]
    - cnt_shift[2]
    - cnt_shift[3]
    - cnt_shift[4]
    - cnt_shift[5]
    - cnt_stop
    - cnt_reset
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - cnt[0]
    - cnt[1]
    - cnt[2]
    - cnt[3]
    - cnt[4]
    - cnt[5]
    - cnt[6]
    - cnt[7]
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
