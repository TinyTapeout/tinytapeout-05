# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_to_test: |
      The synth is controlled by writing to its configuration registers:
        - Keep the write strobe low when not writing
        - Set the 4 bit write address, and an 8 bit data value
        - While keeping the address and data stable, bring the write strobe high and then low again
            - The write address and data are sampled at 2-10 cycles after the rising edge of the write strobe

      The output comes in two forms:
        - As a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal.
        - As an 8 bit value on the 8 output pins, that can be reconstructed using a resistor ladder.

      The PWM signal should be simpler to use, but be sure reduce the voltage with a resistive divider or similar
      before connecting it to an audio device.
      **Note:Make sure that you know what you are doing when connecting an audio device to the output.
      Don't apply more than 1 V between the terminals of an audio plug this connected to line in.
      5 V direct from the chip might damage your audio device.**
