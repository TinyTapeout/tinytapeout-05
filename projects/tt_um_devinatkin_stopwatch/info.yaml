# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Stop Watch System"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This creates a stop watch type of behavior. It was originally written and verified on the Basys 3 board.
      The Inc Switch controls whether the timer increments or decrements when the increment buttons are pressed. 
      When the timer is running it can be paused by pressing the stop button. The timer can be reset by pressing the soft reset button. 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Provide a 7 segment display, some buttons, and a switch to control the behavior and see the output
