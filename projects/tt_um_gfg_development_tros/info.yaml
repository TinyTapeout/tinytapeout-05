  how_it_works: |
      This design implements three different ring oscillators. The first one is a basic NAND 
      based oscillator. The second one adds additional NAND gates to the outputs of the stages
      of the oscillator to increase the capacitve loading. The last one uses the tri-state
      inverts with a sub-threshold tri-state enable. 

      For measuring the frequencies each oscillator is driving a counter. This counters are
      latched with the latch counter input. With the input transfer counter the currently 
      selected counter (counter select bits) is transfered via the serial data stream. The 
      transfer is driven by the clock of the design. As encoding a manchester encoding is used. 

      Furthermore, a divided version of the clock of each oscillator is outputted. The divisior
      can be configured with the frequency selection bits.
