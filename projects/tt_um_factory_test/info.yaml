project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

    - tt_um_factory_test.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_factory_test"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      If input 0 is high, then a counter is output on the outputs and the bidirectional outputs. Otherwise the inputs are mirrored to the outputs.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set input 0 high. Check the outputs are toggling.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
