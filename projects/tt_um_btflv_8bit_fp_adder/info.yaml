# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Philip Mohr"      # Your name
  title:        "8 bit floating point adder"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Adds two 8 Bit floating point numbers"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Adds two 8 bit floating point numbers under consideration of rounding and infinity cases.
      The two floats use the 8 bit input and the 8 bit bidirectional input.
      1 bit sign, 4 bit exponent, 3 bit mantissa.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Every clock the output should give the addition of the two floats.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
