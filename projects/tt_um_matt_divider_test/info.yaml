# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  language:     "Analog"
  description:  "Test voltage divider"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      3 resistors are used to build a voltage divider connected between power & ground. Output taps are uo_out[2:0]

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Enable the block and check the uo_outputs. Expected that only uo_out[2] is high.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - none
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - UA[0]: divider out 0
    - UA[1]: divider out 1
    - UA[2]: divider out 2
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - not used
