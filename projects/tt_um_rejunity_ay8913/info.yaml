  title:        "Classic 8-bit era Programmable Sound Generator AY-3-8913"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "The AY-3-8913 is a 3-voice programmable sound generator (PSG) chip from General Instruments. The AY-3-8913 is a smaller variant of AY-3-8910 or its analog YM2149."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |

      This Verilog implementation is a replica of the classical **[AY-3-8913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910)** programmable sound generator.
      With roughly a 1500 logic gates this design fits on a **single tile** of the TinyTapeout.
      
      The main goals of this project are:

      1. closely replicate the behavior and eventually the complete **design of the original** AY-3-891x with builtin DACs
      2. provide a readable and well documented code for educational and hardware **preservation** purposes
      3. leverage the **modern fabrication** process

      A significant effort was put into a thorough **test suite** for regression testing and validation against the original chip behavior.

      # Chip technical capabilities

      - **3 square wave** tone generators
      - **1 noise** generator
      - **1 envelope** generator with 10 patterns
      - Capable to produce a range of waves typically from **122 Hz** to **125 kHz**, defined by **12-bit** registers.
      - **16** different volume levels

      # Historical use of the AY-3-891x

      The AY-3-891x family of programmable sound generators was introduced by General Instrument in 1978. Variants of the AY-3-891x were broadly used:

      - home computers: Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Oric-1, Sharp X1, MSX, ZX Spectrum 128/+2/+3
      - game consoles: Intellivision, Vectrex
      - and arcade machines
      
      The AY-3-891x chip family competed with the similar [Texas Instruments SN76489](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76489).

      ### The reverse engineered AY-3-891x 

      This implementation would not be possible without the reverse engineered [schematics and analysis](https://github.com/lvd2/ay-3-8910_reverse_engineered)
      based on decapped [AY-3-8910](https://siliconpr0n.org/map/gi/ay-3-8910) and [AY-3-8914](https://siliconpr0n.org/map/gi/ay-3-8914) chips.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed

      ### Test-suite

      First of all, run the test suite:

      ```
      $ cd src
      $ make
      ```

      ### Connect chip to the speaker

      There are several ways to connect this chip to the microcontroller and speaker.

      One option is to connect off the shelf data parallel Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)
      for example [Digilent R2R Pmod](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodr2r/start) to the output pins and
      route the resulting analog audio to piezo speaker or amplifier.

      Another option is to use the Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) AUDIO OUT pin with OpAmp+capacitor based integrator or capacitor based low-pass filter and a speaker:
