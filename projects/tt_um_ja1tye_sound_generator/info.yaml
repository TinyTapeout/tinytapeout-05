  how_it_works: |
      This project is Small wave table/PSG type sound generator with I2S output.
      Major features are:
      - 4 channel sound generator
      - 4-bit x 32depth wave table (can be uses as 2 of 16depth wave table)
      - 8 selectable waveform (3x pulse,1x noise, 4x wave table)
      - 8-bit volume(only for PSG mode, wave table mode is 4-step volume)
      - 16-bit frequency
      - Sampling Frequency is 48828.125Hz (at 50MHz clock)
      - I2S output (16-bit mono)
      - SPI control interface

      You can control this sound generator by SPI interface.
      SPI mode is mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0), and transaction length is 24-bit.
      first 8-bit is register address, and next 16-bit is data. Data is MSB first.
      
      | Addr | Description | Width |
      | ---- | ---- | ---- |
      | 0x00-0x03 | Frequency[0]-[3] | 16bit |
      | 0x04-0x07 | Volume[0]-[3] | 8bit (lower 8bits are valid)|
      | 0x08-0x0b | Waveform Select[0]-[3] | 3bit (lower 3bits are valid)|
      | 0x20-0x3f | WaveTable[0]-[31] | 4bit (lower 4bits are valid)|

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Connect I2S output to I2S DAC, and control this sound generator by SPI interface.
      SPI input is connected to RP2040's SPI1 on TT05 breakout board.
