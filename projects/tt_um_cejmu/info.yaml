# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "4-Bit ALU" # Project title
  language:     "VHDL" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "A simple 4-Bit ALU which contains two types of adders and multipliers"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The ALU contains a ripple carry adder, a carry lookahead adder, a matrix multiplier and a wallace-tree multiplier. Everything is implemented fully combinational. A 2-bit opcode is used to select the respective component.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test: |
      No clock is required. The first 4 input bits a[3...0] form the first operand, the last 4 input bits b[3...0] form the second operand. The bidirectional input bits 0 and 1 are used as opcode to select the component, c.f. Figure above.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - a[0]
    - a[1]
    - a[2]
    - a[3]
    - b[0]
    - b[1]
    - b[2]
    - b[3]
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - s[0]
    - s[1]
    - s[2]
    - s[3]
    - s[4]
