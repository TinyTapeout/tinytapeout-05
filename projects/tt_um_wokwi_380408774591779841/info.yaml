# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      This project increments a counter from 0 to 25,000,000 and back to zero again. The current value
      of this counter is then passed into a PDM modulator to generate the output. Filtering it with a low
      pass filter (designed for use in the audio range, recommended cutoff ~30 KHz) and then amplifying the
      result will result in usable audio.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Add a suitable RC low pass filter to output pin 7. This can be probed by an oscillocope as-is. To listen to the audio, 
      the output of the RC filter should be attached to a suitable audio amplifier.
