# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Debounces the input signal and counts how many transistions occur in a given period. A state machine
      then divides the count by ten by repeatedly subtracting ten and then displays the tens and units on the seven segment display.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Apply a signal to the signal input and the frequency will be measured and displayed on the seven segment. The dot is used to select between display tens and units.

      To change the count period (to get accurate counts), set it to match the clock frequency: clock_mhz * 100 - 1. So for a 10MHz clock, set to 999.
      Set the desired period (top 4 bits ui_in and all of uio_in) on the bidirectional inputs and toggle load input.

      To debug, enable debug mode and check the bidirectional outputs for state machine, clock count and edge count information.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - signal
    - debug mode (on will put debug signals on bidirectional outputs)
    - load new period. toggle this to register the value in the bidirectional inputs
    - none
    - count period bit 11
    - count period bit 10
    - count period bit 09
    - count period bit 08
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - segment a
    - segment b
    - segment c
    - segment d
    - segment e
    - segment f
    - segment g
    - digit select
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - count period bit 07 or debug edge  bit 2
    - count period bit 06 or debug edge  bit 1
    - count period bit 05 or debug edge  bit 0
    - count period bit 04 or debug clock bit 2
    - count period bit 03 or debug clock bit 1
    - count period bit 02 or debug clock bit 0
    - count period bit 01 or debug state bit 1
    - count period bit 00 or debug state bit 0
