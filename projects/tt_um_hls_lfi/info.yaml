# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

    - lfi.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_hls_lfi"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Phillip Marlowe"      # Your name
  title:        "Simple Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) Neuron"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Given input current, spike when threshold is reached (also assume any files with the letters LFI should be LIF)"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Based on input current, calculation is made using it and previous membrane potential.
      If current membrane potential is above pre-set threshold then spike!

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, input some current and see what happens. Should see an increase on output and possibly a spike eventually.
      
      A current input of 100 after 20 cycles should produce a spike.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - clk_i is the clock
    - current_i is the current input to the LFI neuron
    - rst_n is for reset
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - nu_o is the next membrane potential
    - spike_o is the single bit to show when the neuron is firing
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - msb bit of uio_oe is connected to spike_o
