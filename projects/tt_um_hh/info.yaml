# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Implement a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron in silicon."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Apply an input current injection to the LIF neuron.
      This will modify a neuron membrane potential, and with sufficient current injection, will cause periodic action potentials.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, all state variables will be initialized. A minimum of 2 clock cycles of reset is needed.
      
      An 8-bit input current is then applied to uio_in. The current is treated as the LSB of a 16-bit signal by concatenating 8x0's to the front.
      The first bit is a sign bit, the following 8-bits are treated as the whole number while the final 7-bits are the fraction.
      The current is interpreted in dimensions of uA/cm^2.
      This means the maximum value that can be represented is 1.992 uA/cm^2.

      The membrane potential of the neuron will respond accordingly. Larger currents will elicit more firing. 
      Simulations show that the neuron will start firing, reach a steady state where it stops firing in absence of input stimulus, and start firing again if the current exceeds approximately 8'b00001100 = 8'd12.
