# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  " Information is encoded as a sequence of events or spikes in neuro-inspired computing. Investigating how information is represented and processed as spike trains is of particular interest. This chip implements several test clusters featuring various spike trains. "      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The input clock is connected with the inputs of the neuron clusters. The bi-directional pins are provided where external input stimulus could be provided. The raster spiking plots are generated to observe the variability of different spiking neuron clusters. 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Provide input clock frequencies to the neuron clusters and observe the output through the oscilloscope.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - CLOCK Attached to the on-board clock
    - INO Connected with a 1-bit FF
    - IN1 external input to the MUX
    - IN2 Enable signal to the MUX  
    - IN3 Connected as a SELECT pin for the MUX (connected with (1x3x2x1) and (6x6x6) cluster.
    - IN4 Input to the (6x6x6) cluster 
    - IN5 Input to the (6x6x6) cluster
    - IN6 Input to the (6x6x6) cluster
    - IN7 Input to the (6x6x6) cluster
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - OUT0 on-board CLOCK 
    - OUT1 Output from the LFSR
    - OUT2 Output from 2-bit FF

# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - D0  OUTPUT from a 1-bit FF

    - D1 OUTPUT from the (5X5) cluster  
    - D2 OUTPUT from (6x6x6) cluster
    - D3 OUTPUT from (6x6x6) cluster
    - D4 connected as an OUTPUT pin from either the (6x6x6) cluster or the (1x3x2x1) cluster (where IN3 is the input select pin)
    - D5 INPUT to the (6x6x6) cluster
    - D6 INPUT to the (6x6x6) cluster
