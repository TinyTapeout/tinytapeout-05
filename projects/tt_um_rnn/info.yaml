# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

    - rnn.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_rnn"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Count up to 10, one second at a time."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Apply an input current to an RNN hidden state, where the hidden state will multiply with a 8x8 matrix.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the hidden state will be set to 0.

      Then change the inputs to change the current. You can read the output current to know the result.
