  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
  source_files:
    - tt_um_jleugeri_ticktocktokens.sv
    - ttt_processor.sv
  top_module:  "tt_um_jleugeri_ticktocktokens"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml
documentation: 
  author:       "Johannes Leugering"      # Your name
  title:        "TickTockTokens"      # Project title
  language:     "SystemVerilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Implementation of a processor that uses Tick Tock Tokens for event-based computation."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Each TickTockToken (ttt) is indicated by two messages, a start and an end event. A ttt-Processor uses these tokens to perform event-based computations in a fashion inspired by Time Petri Nets. 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      If I didn't get lazy half-way though, the test-script provided in the repo should run a test model successfully, and the documentation should provide a more through explanation.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:             
    - instruction bit 0
    - instruction bit 1
    - instruction bit 2
    - instruction bit 3

# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - data bit 0 | token start flag
