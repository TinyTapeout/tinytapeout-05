# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

  top_module:  "tt_um_mihailocode_neural_network"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Neural network built out of perceptrons"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    Network calculates output based on user provided input and predefined weight parameters of neural network 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Drive inputs to [7:0] ui_in and result of computation of neural network can be obesrved on [7:0] uo_out
# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
