# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Matt Ngaw"      # Your name
  title:        "8-bit Floating-Point Adder"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "A floating-point adder following the FP8 E5M2 standard."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The circuit combinationally computes the floating-point sum.
      
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Hold two 8-bit inputs on the input and bi-directional pins, and the 
      floating-point sum comes out of the output pins.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - input 1 bit 0
    - input 1 bit 1
    - input 1 bit 2
    - input 1 bit 3
    - input 1 bit 4
    - input 1 bit 5
    - input 1 bit 6
    - input 1 bit 7
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - output bit 0
    - output bit 1
    - output bit 2
    - output bit 3
    - output bit 4
    - output bit 5

    - output bit 7
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - input 2 bit 0
