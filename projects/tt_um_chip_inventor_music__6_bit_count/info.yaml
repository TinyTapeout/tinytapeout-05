# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "6 bit Counter and Piano Music created by Chip Inventor"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Chip Inventor"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      There are two diagrams created by the Chip Inventor platform, whereas by using blocks, you can create your own semiconductor design.
      The piano tune is one diagram. A song-throwing buzzer can be configured with one button and a buzzer.
      A 6-bit counter diagram is the other.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Using a buzzer, it's possible to listen to a music note.
      Connecting 4 LEDs in pull_up makes it possible to see the binary value.
