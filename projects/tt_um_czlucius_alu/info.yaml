# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      The input 8 bits are split into the upper 4 bits (value y), and lower 4 bits (value x).
      Depending on the instruction given after the select pin, operations will be performed on the values to give an 8 bit output.
      The select pins use the bi-directional I/O.

      |Select (bidi 3 - 0)|Operation|
      |0|+|
      |1|-|
      |2|*|
      |3|/|
      |4|bitwise AND|
      |5|bitwise OR|
      |6|bitwise XOR|
      |7|bitwise NAND|
      |8|bitwise NOR|
      |9|~ (negation of 8 bits)|
      |10|% (modulo)|
      |11|<< (left shift)|
      |12|>> (right shift)|

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with a 10MHz input clock.
      Experiment by changing the inputs to change the counting speed.
