  how_it_works: |
      
      Uses a set of registers to implement a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron for spike-timing dependent plasticity learning (STDP) rule.
       Two LIF neurons are instantiated and a stdp module handles the logic for the timing and weight update.


# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test: |
      
      After reset, a current is applied at different amplitudes and the input to the neuron is integrated at every clock cycle
      If a pre-synaptic spike and post-synaptic spike occurs, time difference is measured and applied to the synatic weight update
      for this connection.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - drive current
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - LIF spike
    - LIF state
    - synaptic weight
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - second counter bit 0
    - second counter bit 1
    - second counter bit 2
    - second counter bit 3
    - second counter bit 4
    - second counter bit 5
    - second counter bit 6
    - second counter bit 7
