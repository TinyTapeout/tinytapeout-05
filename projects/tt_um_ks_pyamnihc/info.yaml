  title:        "Karplus-Strong String Synthesis"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Plucked string sound synthesizer"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    This is simplified implementation of Karplus-Strong (KS) string synthesis based on papers, [Digital Synthesis of Plucked-String and Drum Timbres](https://doi.org/10.2307/3680062) and [Extensions of the Karplus-Strong Plucked-String Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.2307/3680063). 
    
    A register map controls and configures the KS synthesis module. This register map is accessed through a SPI interface. Synthesized sound samples can be accessed through the I2S transmitter interface.

    ### SPI Frame
    SPI Mode: CPOL = 0, CPHA = 1

    The 16-bit SPI frame is defined as,

    |	Read=1/Write=0	|	Address[6:0]	|	Data[7:0]	|
    | --- | --- | --- |

    ### Register Map
    The Register Map has 16 Registers of 8-bits each.

    Complete register map is described in the repository at [https://github.com/pyamnihc/tt04-um-ks-pyamnihc](https://github.com/pyamnihc/tt04-um-ks-pyamnihc).

    ### I2S Transmitter
    The 8-bit signed sound samples can be read out at `f_sck = 256 kHz` through this interface.


# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    Connect a clock with frequency `f_clk = 256 kHz` and apply a reset cycle to initialize the design, this sets the audio sample rate at `fs = 16 kHz`. Use the spi register map or the ui_in to futher configure the design. The synthesized samples are sent continuously on the I2S transmitter interface.
