  top_module:  "tt_um_rjmorgan11_calculator_chip"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Basic ALU. Use the input pins to specify an 8 bit number and output pins to view result. IO pin 0 is the enter pin, assert high to enter command/value. IO pins 4-1 are used to select the command for the ALU. IO pins 7-5 are for flags.
      Ops:
      0x0: add
      0x1: subtract
      0x2: bitwise or
      0x3: bitwise and
      0x4: bitwise xor
      0x5: left shift by 1
      0x6: right shift by 1 (logic)
      0x7: right shift by 1 (arithmetic)
      0x8: 2s compliment negate
      0x9: bitwise invert
      0xA: reverse bitpatern
      0xB: unused
      0xC: unused
      0xD: unsigned input < output
      0xE: unsigned input > output
      0xF: input == output

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      enter a bunch of numbers and ops, should work great

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - NumIn [7:0] number in
    
    - Reset
    - Clock
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - NumOut [7:0] output
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - OpIn [3:0] what op to run
    - Enter      enter command
    - Flags [2:0] overflow, negative, and zero flags
