  title:        "Thermocouple-to-temperature converter (digital backend)"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Converts digitized thermocouple voltage into temperature."

  how_it_works: |
      Converts 10-bit thermocouple ADC counts into temperature by approximating the transfer function with
      piecewise linear segments and interpolating.

      * Interface: SPI (16-bit word)
      * ADC interface: SPI (16-bit word, 10 bits used)
      * Output: Temperature in "centi-celsius", predivided by 4; 16-bit over full positive range of thermocouple type
      * ADC passthrough: When enabled, directly connects SPI master to ADC for configuration
      * Type-J and type-K thermocouples supported

      ADC range: 0 counts = 0 mV = 0 C, max counts (1023) = max mV = max C. Example: For type-K
      thermocouple, 1023 counts = 54.886 mV = 1372 C

      Temperature output: Output is in "centi-Celsius", or hundredths of degrees C, pre-divided by 4, with a granularity of 0.4C.
      ```T = A / 25.0```
      Where T is in degrees C, and A is the value read from SPI. For example, for a type-K thermocouple
      at 415.06C, A = 10376 (0x2888), and T = 415.04. Note the error of 0.02C.

      Configuration: There are two configuration bits. Write to cfg[1:0] by issuing a SPI transaction
      with the high bit set (i.e. write 0x800X).
      * cfg[1]: Thermocouple type: 0 = J, 1 = K
      * cfg[0]: ADC passthrough enable

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Requires a J or K thermocouple analog front-end with compatible ranging. Wait 20 clocks after reset,
      then read 16-bit temperaute from device.
