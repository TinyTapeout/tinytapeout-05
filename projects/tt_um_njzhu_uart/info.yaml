  how_it_works: |
      Given paramaters of the clock frequency and the desired baud rate,
      we can calculate the number of ticks of the clock to correspond to a tick
      at the desired baud rate. Then we can send the start bit, 8 data bits, and 
      a stop bit. Our design uses oversampling to get the value at the middle of 
      the pulse, and then returns our data bit with a read_done signal. For the transmitter, 
      we take a data byte of input and, using the pulse width calculated earlier, 
      send a proper UART sequence with the correct timing.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the receiver will wait for the start bit, and then 8 data bits, 
      and then a stop bit. After reset, we can set the 8 data bits and a data_ready bit
      and the resulting uart transmission sequence will appear on the tx output signal.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - rx bit to signal the bits we receive, dataReady highlighting data is ready for tx
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - bit to test if we want tx or rx
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - segment a / dataOut[0] / tx for uart packet bits
    - segment b / dataOut[1]
    - segment c / dataOut[2]
    - segment d / dataOut[3]
    - segment e / dataOut[4]
    - segment f / dataOut[5]
    - segment g / dataOut[6]
    - segment h / dataOut[7]
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - finished_read - finished reception / dataIn[0]
    - dataIn[1]
    - dataIn[2]
    - dataIn[3]
    - dataIn[4]
    - dataIn[5]
