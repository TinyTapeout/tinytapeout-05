#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      This project is an edited version of the example CUSTOMISABLE DESIGN - UART from digital design guide. Implements a a UART transmitter using registers made from D-flip flops and multiplexers.
      The characters QSM are sent continuously.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      To begin transmission:
      1. Connect CLK signal
      2. Set IN6 ("Load") to OFF
      3. Set IN7 ("Output Enable") to ON
      4. Set IN6 ("Load") to ON
      
# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - IN6 - Load | TX
    - IN7 - Output enable
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - OUT0 - Output enable indicator
    - OUT1 - Load | TX indicator

# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - not used
