  title:        "UART Greeter with RNN Module"
  language:     "Wokwi" # sad I don't have time to relearn Verilog before TT05 closes
  description:  "Sends 'Hello' over UART and fills die space with metastability"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The UART transmitter is just a shift register with hardcoded initial values.
      The output of the shift register is fed back into itself in an infinite loop.
      The "RNN" is a few flip-flops feeding into each other to use up die space. :)

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Testing UART is simple:
      1. Connect the UART output to a microcontroller or scope.
      2. Set load/enable low (load).
      3. Set output enable high.
      4. Set load/enable high (enable).
      5. Observe as the string "Hello\n" is sent over UART.

      The RNN module is trained on random Wokwi wiring, and might be smarter than a single human neuron.
      It probably detects something we mortals cannot comprehend, and is tied to inputs 0-3 and outputs 0-3.
      It may be fun to drive these with a very fast clock.
