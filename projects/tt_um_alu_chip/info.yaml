project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

  top_module:  "tt_um_alu_chip"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Devan Grover & Siddharth Kunisetty"      # Your name
  title:        "ALU Chip"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "ALU Chip that outputs 7 Segment"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This is a simple, 4 bit ALU that outputs its result on a 7 Segment Display.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Explain how to test your project

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - alu_in_1 [7:4] - First input into the ALU
    - alu_in_2 [3:0] - Second input into the ALU
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - 7 Segment Out [6:0] - Output to the 7 Segment display
    - None [7] - NC
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - alu_out [7:4] (OUT) - Output BCD value of operation
    - alu_op_in [3:0] (IN) - Input operation for the ALU (ADD, SUBTRACT, AND, OR, EQUALS, NOT, GT, LT)
