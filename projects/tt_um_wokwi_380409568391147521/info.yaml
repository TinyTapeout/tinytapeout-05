# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    380409568391147521        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Simple hardware trojan circuit described by Ryan Cornateanu in a medium article"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Based off of medium article by Ryan Cornateanu: "Hardware Trojans IUnder a Microscope https://ryancor.medium.com/hardware-trojans-under-a-microscope-bf542acbcc29

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Use DIP switches as input, 1- 4 is for normal circuit that would be considered "secure", and 5 - 8 for compromised circuit with embedded Hardware Trojan
      

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:

    - r1_trojan
    - r2_trojan
    - r3_trojan
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
