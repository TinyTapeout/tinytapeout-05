# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      The inputs ui_in[7:0] are used to control an 8-bit DAC.
      The value of the input increases and decreases the frequency of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).
      The larger the value of the 8-bit input, the faster the frequency is output.
      The oscillator is output on uo_out[0].
      The frequency range of the VCO is not yet completely characterized, but at this time I expect form 1-30 MHz.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      The project can be tested by measuring the output of uo_out[0]. The input ui_in[7:0] can then be put to anything you like.
