# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Apply an input current injection to the IF neuron using switches.

      The IF neuron model fires a spike as soon as the input voltage crosses 
      the specified threshold without considering any leakage or time-dependent state.
      
      #This gets added to a membrane potential 
      If the membrane potential exceeds the threshold then trigger a spike. 

    

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the membrane potential set to 0. 

      Then change the inputs to change the current. A higher current should trigger a higher firing rate.
