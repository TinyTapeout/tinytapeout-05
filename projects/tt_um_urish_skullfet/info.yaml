# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Hand-crafted, skull-shaped MOSFET transistors. ☠️

      The project contains three SkullFET devices: a NOT gate, a NAND gate, and a SR flip-flop.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Input some values into A and B, and observe the outputs. The first output is connected to the SkullFET inverter, and the second output
      is connected to the SkullFET NAND gate.

      Pulse ~S to set the SkullFlop (Q), and pulse ~R to reset it.
