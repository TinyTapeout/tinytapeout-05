# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Reads from two 8-bit input and creates a weighted sum  
      of the 16 bits.

      The 8-bit wieights are default 10000000 and are unuptatable.
      (10000000 represents 0.5 if the you conceptualize a . on the far left
      or represents 128 if you conceptualize a . on the far right)

      If the weighted sum is greater than the threshold, 11111110, than it
      will classify the input as 1 otherwise it will classify it as 0.

      9 + 10 = 21

      Any input with all 0's should be classified as 0.

      Math: 
      
      Note: The threshold is 11111110 which can be thought of as 0.99993896484

      w0*i0 + w1*i1 + ... + w15*i15

      0.5*0 + 0.5*0 + ... + 0.5*0 = 0

      Any input with fifteen 0's and one 1's should be classified as 0.
      
      Math: 
      
      w0*i0 + w1*i1 + ... + w15*i15
      
      0.5*1 + 0.5*0 + ... + 0.5*0 = 0.5

      Any input with two or more 1's should be classified as 1.
      
      Math: 
      
      w0*i0 + w1*i1 + w2*i2 + ... + w15*i15
      
      0.5*1 + 0.5*1 + 0.5*0 + ... + 0.5*0 = 1
      
      0.5*1 + 0.5*1 + 0.5*1 + 0.5*0 + ... + 0.5*0 > 1
